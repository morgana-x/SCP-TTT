# SCP-TTT

Not finished! (Proudly written entirely within ~~3~~ 4 nights between 12am and 3am, obviously bad code)

If you want to contribute, please do because I do not have the time to finish this plugin!

An ~~Exiled ~~9~~ 8~~ PluginAPI plugin that aims to port TTT to SCP Sl

Feel free to check out another gamemode, [Desert Bus](https://github.com/morgana-x/ScpSL-DesertBus), as well!

## Current issues:
+ Spawned weapons have 0 ammo in them (Need to reload them) (And ammo spawns don't have too much ammo in them)
+ Falling death missing corpse death translation
## Todo:
+ Corpse info system (Only thing left is adding missing death translations, and detective specialised things)(Also actually make death translations a dictionary not if statements)
+ Fix restarting round sometimes kicking players due to how long it takes (Need to look at NW code to figure out how to send player to load screen)
+ Automatically set the server to a HeavilyModded Server on plugin load
## Features:
+ Basic Round logic (Round Prep) (Round) (Checks for Innocent, Traitor wins and stalemate) (Round End / Win screen) (Restart)
+ Hud System (Show role, time left) (Works with spectators)
+ Basic Role Allocation ( (Mostly) Faithfully recreated the original Gmod function for this)
+ Highly customisable configuration for team colors, names, win phrases, spawn phrases etc
+ Config option to spawn 30 debug NPCs for testing
+ Custom Corpse Information System
+ Karma System
