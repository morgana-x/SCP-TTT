# SCP-TTT
Not finished! (Proudly written entirely within 7 nights between 12am and 3am, obviously bad code)

If you want to contribute, please do because I do not have the time to finish this plugin!

PluginAPI plugin that aims to port TTT to SCP Sl

Feel free to check out another gamemode, [Desert Bus](https://github.com/morgana-x/ScpSL-DesertBus), as well!

## Current issues:
## Todo:
+ Corpse info system (Only thing left is detective specialised things)
+ Update screenshots to reflect major changes
## Features:
+ Round logic (Not faithful win conditions probably, didn't check the gmod function)
+ Hud System (Show role, time left) (Works with spectators)
+ Faithful Role Allocation ( (Mostly) Faithfully recreated the original Gmod function for this)
+ Karma System
+ Traitor Tester At Scp 914
+ Highly customisable configuration
  +  Team colors / names
  +  Win phrases
  +  Spawn phrases
  +  Corpse death info phrases
  +  Traitor Tester conditions (Detective required / min players etc)
