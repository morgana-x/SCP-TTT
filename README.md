# SCP-TTT

Not finished! (Proudly written entirely within 2 nights between 12am and 3am, obviously bad code)

If you want to contribute, please do because I do not have the time to finish this plugin! Feel free to also fork it!

An Exiled ~~9~~ 8 plugin that aims to port TTT to SCP Sl (Exiled 9 is jank af!)

Feel free to check out another gamemode, [Desert Bus](https://github.com/morgana-x/ScpSL-DesertBus), as well!

## Current issues:
+ ~~Players occasionally crash (Either due to the odd 50 items on surface or due to spamming hints every second, or the 30 npcs when testing, Or northwood are bad programmers, (but more likely I'm the bad programer)~~
+ (Crash issue is happening less often)
## Todo:
+ Corpse info system (Only thing left is adding missing death translations, and detective specialised things)
+ clean the bad code up!
+ Better weapon spawning system
+ Show karma display of players your looking at (Good, bad etc), and add karma to detective check
+ Fix restarting round sometimes kicking players due to how long it takes (Need to look at NW code)
## Features:
+ Basic Round logic (Round Prep) (Round) (Checks for Innocent, Traitor wins and stalemate) (Round End / Win screen) (Restart)
+ Hud System (Show role, time left) (Works with spectators)
+ Basic Role Allocation ( (Mostly) Faithfully recreated the original Gmod function for this)
+ Highly customisable configuration for team colors, names, win phrases, spawn phrases etc
+ Config option to spawn 30 debug NPCs for testing
+ Custom Corpse Information System
