# SCP-TTT

Not finished!

An Exiled 9 plugin that aims to port TTT to SCP Sl, probably my last plugin for this god awful game!

## Current issues:
+ Players occasionally crash (Either due to the odd 50 items on surface or due to spamming hints every second. Or northwood are bad programmers, (but more likely I'm the bad programer)

## Todo:
+ Corpse info system
+ Class loadouts for detective
+ clean the bad code up!
+ Better weapon spawning system, (Right now just spawns stuff in specific places on surface)
+ Switch "Map" to Light containment after above is done
+ Disable Light Containment Decontamination?
